### About Julie

Julie is a component library and design system created for
[Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform). It empowers developers
to design beautiful, consistent, and accessible user interfaces across various platforms.

Designed for `Compose Multiplatform`, Julie works seamlessly across `Android`, `Desktop`, `Web`, and
`iOS` with a shared codebase using Kotlin Multiplatform.

It offers a wide range of UI components, such as `buttons`, `text fields`, `cards`, and pretty much
everything you need to create a beautiful and rich user interface for your products.

Note: Julie does not support `XML`, `SwiftUI`, or any other toolkits. It is primarily designed for
`Compose Multiplatform`. However, you can use Julie in your regular `Jetpack Compose` projects
without any issues. Julie offers support for `React JS` on the web; however, this support is limited
and is not the library's main focus.

### Learning guide

Check out the [Julie learning guides](http://heyysudarshan.github.io/julie/learn-julie) to learn how
to use Julie effectively in your project. The guide not only teaches you how to use each component
but also explains the design thinking behind it.

### Installation guide

To get started, add the Julie library to your existing Gradle project. To include Julie in any
module, copy and paste the following line into your module's `build.gradle.kts` file under the
`dependencies` block as shown below.

#### For Android projects

```groovy
dependencies {
    // Other dependencies will go here
    implementation("io.github.heyysudarshan:julie:1.0.0")
}
```

#### For Compose Multiplatform projects

```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain.dependencies {
            // Other dependencies will go here
            implementation("io.github.heyysudarshan:julie:1.0.0")
        }
    }
}  
```

If your project uses a version catalog for centralized dependency management, add the following line
to your `libs.versions.toml` file:

```
[versions]
# Other version declarations will go here
julie = "1.0.0"

[libraries]
# Other libraries declarations will go here
julie = { module = "io.github.heyysudarshan:julie", version.ref = "julie" }
```

Then you can refer to the dependency in your `build.gradle` like this:

#### For Android projects

```groovy
dependencies {
    // Other dependencies will go here
    implementation(libs.julie)
}
```

#### For Compose Multiplatform projects

```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain.dependencies {
            // Other dependencies will go here
            implementation(libs.julie)
        }
    }
}  
```

### For React projects

```kotlin
npm i julie - react
```

### Why Julie?

With so many component libraries out there, itâ€™s fair to ask, why build another one? Android
developers often rely on Googleâ€™s `Material 3`, while web developers use libraries like `Shadcn` or
`TailwindCSS`. But these are mostly platform-specific. Even though `Material 3` supports
`Compose Multiplatform`, I found it lacking the visual appeal and smooth experience I was aiming
for. That said, its design guidelines are still highly valuable.

Thatâ€™s why I set out to build this component library and design system. While it takes inspiration
from Material 3â€™s typography and principles, it introduces visually appealing and thoughtfully
crafted components from the start. The goal is to maintain a cohesive visual style and user
experience across all platforms.

### Thank you ðŸ™Œ

Thank you for checking out this project! What started as a personal project is now evolving into
something more meaningful. If you're a designer with suggestions, I'd love to hear them. Please
think about giving the GitHub repository a star if you value the work. Happy coding!
