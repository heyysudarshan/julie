### About Julie

Julie is a component library and design system that helps you build beautiful, consistent, and
accessible user interfaces with ease. It offers a wide range of UI elements like `buttons`, `text
fields`, and `cards`, so you can focus on your appâ€™s functionality while Julie handles the design.

Designed for `Compose Multiplatform`, Julie works seamlessly across `Android`, `desktop`, `web`, and
`iOS` with a shared codebase using `Compose Multiplatform`. It's also available for web projects
using `React`, bringing the same smooth animations and high-quality UI/UX to every platform.
