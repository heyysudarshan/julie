### About Julie

Julie is a component library and design system developed for
[Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform). It empowers developers
to design beautiful, consistent, and accessible user interfaces across various platforms.

Designed for `Compose Multiplatform`, Julie works seamlessly across `Android`, `Desktop`, `Web`, and
`iOS` with a shared codebase using
[Kotlin Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/kotlin-multiplatform/).

> ***Note***: Julie does not support `XML`, `SwiftUI`, or any other toolkits. It is primarily
> designed for `Compose Multiplatform`.
>
> However, you can use Julie in your regular `Jetpack Compose` projects
> without any issues. Julie offers support for `React JS` on the web; however, this support is
> limited and is not the library's main focus.

It offers a wide range of UI components, such as `buttons`, `text fields`, `cards`, and pretty much
everything you need to create a beautiful and rich user interface for your products. See
[Components](http://heyysudarshan.github.io/julie/components) for a list of all available
components in Julie.

### Learning guide

If you're new to Julie, then don't worry; check out the
[Julie learning guide](http://heyysudarshan.github.io/julie/learn-julie) to learn how to use Julie
effectively in your project. The guide not only teaches you how to use each component but also
explains the design thinking behind it. Also, if you're new to the world of `UI/UX`, the guide also
covers important topics on how to build user-centric applications.

### Installation guide

To get started, add the Julie dependency to your existing `Gradle` project. To make Julie available
in any module's classpath, copy and paste the following line into your module's `build.gradle.kts`
file under the `dependencies` block as shown below.

#### For Android project

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // Other dependencies will go here
    implementation("io.github.heyysudarshan:julie:1.0.0")
}
```

For quickly copying the dependency, you can use the following command:

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.heyysudarshan:julie:1.0.0")
```

#### For Compose Multiplatform project

```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain.dependencies {
            // Other dependencies will go here
            implementation("io.github.heyysudarshan:julie:1.0.0")
        }
    }
}  
```

For quickly copying the dependency, you can use the following command:

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.heyysudarshan:julie:1.0.0")
```

If your project uses a version catalog for centralized dependency management, add the following
lines to your `libs.versions.toml` file:

```
[versions]
# Other version declarations will go here
julie = "1.0.0"

[libraries]
# Other libraries declarations will go here
julie = { module = "io.github.heyysudarshan:julie", version.ref = "julie" }
```

Then you can refer to the dependency in your `build.gradle` like this:

#### For Android projects

```groovy
dependencies {
    // Other dependencies will go here
    implementation(libs.julie)
}
```

For quickly copying the dependency, you can use the following command:

```kotlin
implementation(libs.julie)
```

#### For Compose Multiplatform projects

```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain.dependencies {
            // Other dependencies will go here
            implementation(libs.julie)
        }
    }
}  
```

For quickly copying the dependency, you can use the following command:

```kotlin
implementation(libs.julie)
```

### For React projects

If you're using React, you can install the library using the following command:

```shell
npm i julie-react
```

### Why Julie?

With so many component libraries out there, itâ€™s fair to ask, why build another one? Android
developers often rely on Googleâ€™s `Material 3`, while web developers use libraries like `Shadcn` or
`TailwindCSS`. But these are mostly platform-specific. Even though `Material 3` supports
`Compose Multiplatform`, I found it lacking the visual appeal and smooth experience I was aiming
for. That said, its design guidelines are still highly valuable.

Thatâ€™s why I set out to build this component library and design system. While it takes inspiration
from Material 3â€™s typography and principles, it introduces visually appealing and thoughtfully
crafted components from the start. The goal is to maintain a cohesive visual style and user
experience across all platforms.

### Thank you ðŸ™Œ

Thank you for checking out this project! What started as a personal project is now evolving into
something more meaningful. If you're a designer with suggestions, I'd love to hear them. Please
think about giving the GitHub repository a star if you value the work. Happy coding!
